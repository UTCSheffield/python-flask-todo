# Design Your Own App


The code we have been working with recently is especially suited to joining people to data without storing any PII in your app. 

* Todo Lists
* Fitness Trackers
* Collection trackers
* Want / Shopping lists

---

## Do you have a hobby?

You you collect things or track a team or band?

---
## What?

* What problem would you like to solve.
* What do you want to record, calculate, map or workout? 
### Write it down

---

## Entities

* What **things/entities** are in that?
* What properties do they have
* Who has that information?

---

## Decide on a name & simple design

* Write down your ideas.
* Talk to sir to check it.

---

## Fork your todo-app 


* Use Github Desktop to get you new project locally
* Copy the .env file from your Todo app
* Run it and you should see the Todo App working

---

## Start changing the names 

* Classes, functions and variables cans be changed with F2
* Change the variables in the  templates and everything else to match
*  Talk to each other about what breaks
